# Cipheroo

This is a simple JavaScript app that allows the user to encode a message of their own choosing and send it to someone to decrypt later (along with a password to use).

This can be used for fun and games, to send a secret message to a loved one or simply to not forget something important that's better kept hidden...

Feel free to try it out!

* **Results:**
Here is where the app provides the user with a ciphered code and a password, or a decrypted code, depending on which page they're at.

## Features left to implement:
* One feature that could add value to this code is if the users themselves could input passwords for their codes of their own choosing. This can be done, but will take some time to implement.
* Another easier target would be to be able to also encode other symbols other than letters.

## Testing:
* This webpage was tested on the following browsers: Firefox, Safari and Chrome. It worked on all of them.
* This project is responsive on all device sizes, it was tested through DevTools and opening it on phones, tablets and computers.
* The contrast of colors and letter sizing makes the webpage easy to read and understand.
* All of the buttons work and do their function correctly.

## Bugs:
* Along the creation of the website, some bugs appeared, but they were solved as they came up.
* It was very difficult to get the program to decode the code, as I was storing the wrong information within the wrong variables.Eventually, by sitting down and writing in pen and paper every single step the computer took to decrypt the code, I found the mistake and solved it.

## Unsolved Bugs:
* At the moment, there are no unsolved bugs that I am aware of in this app.

## Validator testing:

* HTML: No errors were found when passing the code through the official W3C validator.
* CSS: No errors were found when passing the code through the official W3C validator.

## Deployment:
* The site is deployed on GitHub pages. The steps followed to deploy it are the following:
  *  Navigate to the Git repository page and go into *settings*
  *  Select Master-Branch from the dropdown menu
  *  Click on the link provided by the page
